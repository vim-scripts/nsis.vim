NSIS stands for 'NullSoft Installation System' and is a handy free scriptable installation system made by NullSoft ( the 
guys who made Winamp). For more information on this, see http://www.nullsoft.com/free/nsis/
This syntax is very straight forward as the syntax of the scripting language is simple. 

If you use NSIS, please give it a try and tell me what you think as this is the first I actually write and vim syntax file.
Thanks,
